# The Hard Way

Sometimes I feel that I don't really understand some basic, high level concepts and I like to dig deeper into the unknown to get better touch of lower level implementation and once this make sense, the higher level looks like common sense.

This is what 'the hard way' series is all about, going deep into implementation details and doing it yourself (DIY), a bottom up approach.
